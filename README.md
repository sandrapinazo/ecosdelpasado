# Ecos del Pasado

This project is a webpage for a roleplaying game with friends.
I'm using this to practice some vanilla JavaScript making something fun. 

## Description

This is a simple webpage consisting on 4 pages:

- Index/Landing: with a simple welcome text.
- Thea's News: a news board where you can also create news. News are sorted by date and you can also filter them by location. Locations in the left are each diferent location for the existing news, if you create a new with diferent locations it's added to the list.
- Map: WIP. Map of the territory. 
- La party: WIP. This page is just a sumary of the members of the party. It has an opening book animation when it loads the page.

I'm using http://myjson.com/ api to store my news.

## Roadmap
Some ideas for releases:
- Finish "La party" page. When clicking a name from the list it should show you info of that character on the right page.
- Add the path the party is making while traveling with a svg and drawing effect on the map.

## Contributing
Issues are welcome ass well as new ideas and ways to improve :)
